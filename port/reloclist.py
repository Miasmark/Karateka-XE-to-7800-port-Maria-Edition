"""
The relocation list: every byte of XEGS Karateka that is the high half of an
address, and the region it points into.

Every move in the 7800 layout is a whole number of pages, so an address's
low byte never changes; relocating means adding the region's page delta to
its high bytes. That needs only where the high bytes are and which region
each points into.

Sources:
  - the origin trace's direct origins (the stored byte *is* the pointer's
    high byte), from work/analysis/origin/origin*.txt
  - the cases found by reading the code (MANUAL below): framebuffer constants
    that are only compared, and the small-sprite block's base

    python port/reloclist.py > work/analysis/reloc.txt

Output lines:  scene|*  location  imm|byte  value  region  target
  scene   the scene whose banks hold the byte, or * for shared segments
  imm     an immediate operand (the location is the operand byte)
  target  the lowest address a pointer built with this byte reached
